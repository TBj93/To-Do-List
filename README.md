# To-Do-List

### Description
This is a basic to do list app, that can be run in any browser by opening the index.html file.

### Key features

The app enables to insert notes; delete them, cross them out ( if the task is finished for example), revert corssing them out or switch their order.

## Challenges

I had to read through the jquery documentation, since I wasn't familiar with the jquery library initially. For example, I needed to find an appropriate function to switch between crossed out notes and their reverts, which turned out to be the "toggle" function of the jquery library

## Technologies used

Html, CSS, Js/Jquery
